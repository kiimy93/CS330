Throughout this project, I learned how to bring a 3D scene to life using basic shapes, textures, and lighting in OpenGL. One of the biggest design skills I developed was figuring out how to build recognizable objects using polygon shapes and then using materials and lighting to give them more detail. I followed a reference image to guide how I arranged the scene and made decisions about what objects to include and how to place them for realism.

As I developed the program, I picked up new strategies like adjusting UV scaling and writing modular code with clear functions. I used iteration a lotâ€”every week I made progress, tweaked things, tested them, and made changes. This helped me see how each small improvement added up to a better final result. Over time, I got better at structuring my code and troubleshooting bugs.

Overall, this project helped me see how computer graphics can tie into both my creative interests and my technical skills. I now understand how OpenGL renders objects, textures, and lighting, and that gives me a solid foundation if I ever want to pursue game development, visualization, or interactive applications in the future.
